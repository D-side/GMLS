<h3><i class="icon-lightbulb"> </i>The idea</h3>
<div class="well well-sm">
	<p>We keep a list of weird GML snippets, similar to a way <a href="http://wtfjs.com">WTFJS</a> does this with JavaScript. But since GML is a much simpler language, there aren't that many WTFs* to be discovered.</p>
	<p>So this site is listing any notable snippets of GML, be it their weirdness, their usefulness or rarity. Code is kept in format that allows its bulk export into GameMaker. This feature is not complete so far, but stay tuned! We'll have it one day.</p>
</div>

<h3><i class="icon-plus-sign-alt"> </i>How to contribute</h3>
<div class="well well-sm">
	<p>Either hit me with a pull request on <a href="http://github.com/D-side/GMLS">GitHub</a>, that is easiest for me. If you don't have the skills or time for that, email me at <code>me<i class="icon-globe"></i>dside.ru</code>, but that might take more time for your code to appear here.</p>
	<p>By default, I specify you as the author in a way you have been available upon my discovery of your code, if it happens to be interesting. In essence, if I happen to find your code on VK, your VK page will be specified. However, you can always affect that if you send me code yourself. I will try to contact the author myself, but if that takes significant effort, I publish the code with attribution i find sufficient. If you disagree &#8211; see below.</p>
</div>

<h3><i class="icon-frown"> </i>I don't want my code to be here!</h3>
<div class="well well-sm">
<p>Yeah, while that expression might be on your face, it might be on my own face as well. Same rules as above: send me a note or a pull request, and I will remove the code as long as you're the author. Bear in mind though, that I can't remove it from code history, so it will remain published in the source code, but will not be accessible through the web.<p>
<p>Same rules apply if you are not content with how you've been referenced as the author. I value your opinion: send me a note with exact details you want mentioned. I reserve the right to remove your code from this site if keeping it with your requirements in place is worse than not keeping it at all. This is unlikely to happen though, because the force is HTML is strong.</p>
</p>The site is open-source and MIT licensed, and it's for the greater good, trust me.</p>
