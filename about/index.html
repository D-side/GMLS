<p>The idea of this site was initially to keep a list of weird GML snippets, similar to a way <a href="http://wtfjs.com">WTFJS</a> does this with JavaScript. But since GML is a much simpler language, there aren't that many WTFs to be discovered.</p>
<p>So this site is listing any useful snippets</p>

<p class="well well-sm"><small><i>WTF above is an abbrevation of "What a Terrible Failure", and means a situation where the language acts in a weird manner.</i></small></p>
